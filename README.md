# TTA-Portfolio
This repo is for my portfolio as it gets updated and personalized through the bootcamp.
I plan to update this in an increasingly accurate-to-me style that I have yet to figure out. 
Part of it is that I am not terribly artistically gifted so all my visual creativity lives in my head. 
However, with coding I am able to express that more and more. So as I continue to get familiar with various coding concepts I 
will be adding more of a personal touch. As of 1/4/22, I have added a "Who am I?" section as well as updated/improved contact methods. I have also cleaned
up some of the text throughout the page to not leak onto other areas or get lost behind anything. 

And it features a video I never thought I would find a practical use for, which is me studying for finals my sophomore year of college! 
I had some methods that weren't the best but made for great timelapses (I would completely retype/rewrite an entire semester's worth of notes for almost each class...)
