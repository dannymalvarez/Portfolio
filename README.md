# TTA-Portfolio
This repo is for my portfolio as it gets updated and personalized through the bootcamp.
My portfolio is an opportunity to show potential employers what I can create and also serves to characterize me a bit. It includes a couple different pieces of info like pictures of me and my family, a quote I like, and some written up descriptions. It also includes links to my various repositories. 

I am open to suggestions on improvements as they would serve as more practice for me. That would also give me more ways to express myself through my site which is always a good thing! 

If you are interested in learning how I created this I would be glad to discuss! You can reach me through either LinkedIn or email, both of which are listed in the site.

As of now, I am the sole contributor to this project.

Fun fact: My portfolio features a video I never thought I would find a practical use for, which is me studying for finals my sophomore year of college! 
I had some methods that weren't the best but made for great timelapses (I would completely retype/rewrite an entire semester's worth of notes for almost each class...)
